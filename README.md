### What is Hugo?
Hugo is the fastest and possibly best CMS / static site generator ever written. Hugo is what the creator of zombocom hoped to one day accomplish. [Start Here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

### Whats this then?
[Hugo the tool](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) is hosted on github, and [I've forked that as well](https://github.com/forrest321/hugo) - but *_this is a dummy site built with Hugo_*, using tutorials and tips from around the web, which I'll do my best to catalog here. There is no real content here, just the configuration of a hugo site and as little dummy text / data as needed to get it working.
